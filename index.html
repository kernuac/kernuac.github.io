                    <h3>Technology Support Engineer at Universidad de Atacama, Chile</h3>
                    <p>As a developer at Universidad de Atacama, Chile, I collaborated in the development
                of an On-line Academic Requests System for our students, This application was written using 
                PHP as server side language, MS-SQL Server for storing data and HTML5 + CSS3 +
                Javascript for the frontend. With this new software, the time for resolving students 
                request decreased from 15 days to 5 days.</p>
                    <p>When the new faculty was created, the first task was to implement networks and
                services. I had to implement a firewall with linux and iptables, 
                a proxy/cache server with squid, two Domain controllers on Windows Server 2008, 
                a Web server and a captive portal connected with active directory on the Domain
                Controllers. The Proxy Server, Web Server, and some others were virtualized using 
                Xen hypervisor. This structure allowed to control network traffic and the good use
                of workstations, minimizing issues for viruses and corrective maintenances.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Support Engineer at Holding San Carlos, Chile</h3>
                    <p>
                        While I was working for this company, I created some applications for supporting the
                main activities there, for example: a Workflow System, a Purchase Requests System,
                etc. Each application was written as modules for e107-CMS in PHP.
                These applications helped to take decisions faster and standardize process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other Hand, I had to control the network traffic and apply some restrictions for
                accessing to Internet. So, I implemented a little firewall on a Linux machine
                with iptables, a Proxy/Cache with Squid, for filtering content,
                and some monitors like NTOP for analizing traffic and Calamaris for 
                analizing Squid's logs. Also, I defined a range of hours when workers can access to
                internet with out restrictions. Finally, the network traffic was optimized after
                that.

                    <h3>Technical Support Engineer at Universidad del Mar, Chile</h3>
                    <p>
                        Working for this university, I had to maintain current systems and implementing a 
                Firewall, a Domain controller and a Captive Portal. Current systems was a Proxy
                Cache with SQUID and, a web server. First, I configured a firewall with iptables on a Linux
                machine. The next task was to implemet a Domain controller on Windows Server 2008.
                Finally, I worked in a Captive Portal using PFSense and connected to the Domain
                Controller. This made stronger our infrastructure and minimized issues for viruses
                and corrective maintenances of workstations.
